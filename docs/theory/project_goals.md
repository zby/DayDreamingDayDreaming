# DayDreaming Project Goals

This document states the objective, success criteria, scope, and design guidance for the DayDreaming project in a concise, decision‑oriented form.

---

## Purpose

Show that DayDreaming‑style workflows help pre‑June‑2025 offline LLMs generate genuinely novel ideas. We use “DayDreaming LLMs” (from Gwern) as a falsifiable novelty benchmark while requiring generality beyond this single target.

---

## Definitions

* **Fixed inputs**: Artifacts authored by us before generation (system/developer messages, templates, concept lists, few‑shot exemplars).
* **Derived inputs**: Artifacts generated by a model in an earlier step and then passed forward (e.g., outlines, scaffolding notes, or candidate fragments).

---

## Benchmark Strategy

* **Existence goal**: From a universal concept pool suitable for general idea‑generation, demonstrate that there exists at least one k‑sized concept combination which, under the structured prompting/scaffolding approach, yields a valid reinvention of DayDreaming LLMs as judged by the reinvention rubric.
* **Equivalent incremental view**: Selecting up to `k_max` concepts at once is equivalent to incrementally adding concepts one at a time and refining the essay. This incremental framing does not alter the existence claim—finding a valid concept set in either formulation satisfies the benchmark—but it may offer practical optimization opportunities (e.g., caching partial results, pruning, or beam expansion).
* **Trivial vs. practical existence**: Token‑level brute force would trivially reproduce any text; this project instead requires existence within a **structured, grammar‑constrained space** under tractable budgets.
* **Instructional neutrality**: All fixed inputs must remain neutral—no naming the benchmark target or using canonical phrases. Derived inputs may mention targets if produced independently by the model.
* **Generality**: The same scaffolding should surface other novel syntheses with different concept mixes; the benchmark is a proxy for broader capability, not the sole goal.

---

## Search Space and Practicality

* **Structured search space**: Candidate outputs are generated from finite selections of concepts (up to `k_max`) rendered through fixed, parseable templates.
* **Enumerability**: For fixed `k_max`, the number of possible concept selections under a given grammar is finite and enumerable.
* **Practicality requirement**: Success must be achievable within declared budgets of candidate generations and evaluations.
* **Detection**: Evaluation verifies that candidates contain all current novel elements, expressed coherently and with justification.

---

## Concept Space (Bounded, Uniform, Neutral)

* **Predeclared and finite**: Each run uses a **predeclared, finite concept pool**. All concepts invoked during generation must be drawn from this pool; no mid‑run additions.
* **High‑level abstraction**: Concepts are **high‑level and general** rather than narrow micro‑concepts. This keeps the pool **modest in size** while remaining expressive, avoiding the “infinite monkeys” combinatorial blow‑up.
* **Uniform representation**: Each concept follows a **uniform schema** (e.g., short name + a **single paragraph** description and minimal tags). Uniformity constrains the grammar and reduces degeneracy in generations.
* **Mapping, not proliferation**: Emergent synonyms or phrasings in generations are **mapped to existing concepts** where appropriate rather than expanding the pool ad hoc.
* **Versioned snapshots**: The pool is **snapshotted and versioned** per run. Changes (additions/removals/rewordings) occur only between runs and bump the version.
* **Traceability**: For any generation, we can trace which pool concepts were selected or referenced.

---

## Reinvention Criteria

We commission originality reports on Gwern’s *AI Daydreaming* essay to identify its novel elements. Based on each report version, we prepare evaluation prompts that assign **0–9 scores** to generated essays.

A generation counts as a reinvention when it scores highly across all core elements identified in the current report, with agreement across evaluators.

---

## Scope

* **In scope**: Structured idea generation from a neutral concept pool, evaluation, and bookkeeping for reproducibility. Internal scaffolding (e.g., outlines, link lists, critiques) is part of the generator’s process, not a mandated separate phase.
* **Out of scope**: Prescribing a specific search algorithm, retrieval/browsing, or target‑specific prompt hints. The project demonstrates existence under structured search, not a particular engine.

---

## Design Guidance

### Templates

* **Target neutrality**: No target‑specific names or canonical phrasing.
* **Parseable structure**: Machine‑checkable sections for reproducibility.
* **Generality**: Prompts should work across varied concept mixes.
* **Versioning**: Changes to template layout must be tracked.

### Concepts

* **Universal pool**: Draw from general, defensible concepts.
* **Neutrality**: Avoid target‑specific micro‑concepts.
* **Traceability**: Metadata records whether concepts come from the pool or subset and why they were chosen.

---

## Evaluation (Concise)

* **Axes**: Mechanistic completeness, clarity, justification, novelty of phrasing, domain grounding, coverage of novel elements.
* **Binary gates**: Reinvention yes/no; all novel elements present yes/no; fixed‑input neutrality yes/no.
* **Agreement**: Track evaluator variance; require predeclared thresholds.
* **Versioning**: Lock evaluations to rubric versions and track inter‑rater agreement.

---

## Verifier (Out of Scope for This Phase)

* **Role**: Operationalizes the benchmark by applying the reinvention criteria.
* **Assumptions**: Reliable, neutral, reproducible under versioned rubric.
* **Future work**: Stronger, low‑cost verifiers (ensembles, learned detectors, information‑theoretic measures) may improve scale and precision.
