**REASONING:**  
The three implementations focus on combinatorial search and feedback loops but **do not directly address the core problem of "static LLMs"** outlined in the original article. Here’s a breakdown:  

1. **Core Concepts**  
   - **The Problem**: Absent. No mention of "static," "frozen," or "amnesiac" LLMs. The systems assume AI is already dynamic. **(0 pts)**  
   - **The Solution**: Partial. Only NICE’s "diffuse mode" loosely resembles daydreaming as background processing. No explicit "daydreaming loop" terminology. **(1 pt)**  
   - **The Mechanism**: Partial. All implementations use generators (hypothesis/CAD/solution creators) and critics (user feedback, reinforcement learning). However, the critic-filter-memory feedback loop is only partially described (e.g., NICE’s user ratings). **(1 pt)**  
   - **The Implications**: Absent. No discussion of "daydreaming tax" or "data moat." Blockchain audit trails and proprietary datasets (ARA/CIP) hint at data moats but lack explicit framing. **(0 pts)**  

2. **Connections**  
   - **Problem → Solution**: Absent. Static LLMs are not mentioned, so no link exists. **(0 pts)**  
   - **Mechanism → Feedback**: Partial. NICE’s feedback loop updates training data, but lacks critic-to-memory integration. ARA’s reinforcement learning adjusts parameters but isn’t framed as memory refinement. **(1 pt)**  
   - **Process → Economics**: Absent. No cost-benefit analysis of computational "tax" or strategic advantage from proprietary data. **(0 pts)**  
   - **Coherent Narrative**: Absent. The text presents three standalone systems, not a unified argument addressing LLM limitations. **(0 pts)**  

**Key Missing Elements**:  
- No critique of static LLMs as the foundational problem.  
- No generator/critic architecture explicitly tied to memory updates.  
- No discussion of computational costs ("tax") or strategic data ownership ("moat").  

**SCORE:** 3/10 (2 for Core Concepts, 1 for Connections)
