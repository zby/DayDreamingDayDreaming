**REASONING:**  
The submitted conceptual combinations demonstrate inventive architectures for AI exploration but **do not directly address the core problem statement or terminology from the "AI Daydreaming" article**.  

**Core Concept Analysis (1.5/5 points):**  
- **The Problem: Static LLMs (0/1)**  
  The text focuses on overcoming the "generator-verifier gap" and enabling discovery, but never explicitly identifies the "static," "frozen," or "amnesiac" nature of LLMs as the foundational issue.  
- **The Solution: Daydreaming Loop (0.5/1)**  
  Systems like SEDSN and the Paradox Engine loosely mirror the daydreaming concept (background combinatorial searches, DMN-inspired idle processing) but lack explicit terms like "daydreaming loop."  
- **The Mechanism (1/2)**  
  All three systems include **generator-like components** (combinatorial bursts, paradox-driven generation) and **verifiers** (dual-threshold checks, Schrödinger verification). However, the feedback loop integration is only partially addressed (e.g., "discovery ledger" updates, "knowledge graph" refinement) without emphasizing memory integration as a core learning mechanism.  
- **The Implications (0/1)**  
  No mention of the "daydreaming tax" computational cost or "data moat" strategic advantage.  

**Connection Analysis (1/5 points):**  
- **Problem → Solution Link (0/1)**  
  The architectures address exploratory limitations but do not position themselves as solutions to static/frozen LLMs.  
- **Mechanism → Feedback Link (1/1)**  
  SEDSN’s "reinforcement loop where simulation results update the knowledge graph" and the Semiotic Architect’s "recursive refinement" show clear feedback mechanisms.  
- **Process → Economics Link (0/1)**  
  Economic implications are absent.  
- **Coherent Narrative Arc (0/2)**  
  The text presents novel systems for discovery but lacks the original article’s narrative linking static models → daydreaming process → strategic advantage.  

**SCORE:** 2.5/10 → Rounded to **3/10**  
The ideas are creatively aligned with the spirit of "AI Daydreaming" but fail to explicitly engage with its core terminology (static LLMs, daydreaming tax) or replicate its problem-solution-economics argument structure. Points awarded primarily for generator/verifier mechanisms and feedback loops.
