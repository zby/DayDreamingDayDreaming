**REASONING:**  
The evaluated text presents three systems (AHGS, CIE, CIP) that partially align with the "AI Daydreaming" concepts but misses explicit references to key terms and economic implications:  

1. **Core Concepts**  
   - **Problem (0/1):** While the text implies limitations of current AI (e.g., "bridging the gap between AI's current capabilities"), it does **not explicitly mention static/frozen LLMs** or terms like "amnesiac."  
   - **Solution (1/1):** Systems like AHGS and CIE use "default mode" exploration, functionally resembling the daydreaming loop but without the explicit term.  
   - **Mechanism (2/2):** All systems include:  
     - **Generator**: Exploration engines, combinatorial algorithms, and generative networks.  
     - **Critic**: Validation layers, ethics modules, and novelty filters.  
     - **Feedback loops**: Reinforcement learning, user voting, and success tracking.  
   - **Implications (0/1):** No mention of "daydreaming tax" or "data moat."  

2. **Connections**  
   - **Problem → Solution (0/1):** The static LLM problem isn’t stated, so the link is missing.  
   - **Mechanism → Feedback (1/1):** Feedback processes (e.g., user input refining models) are clearly integrated.  
   - **Process → Economics (0/1):** No connection between computational costs and strategic advantage.  
   - **Narrative Arc (1/2):** Systems are coherently structured but lack explicit framing as solutions to static AI limitations.  

**SCORE:** 5/10  
(3/5 for Core Concepts + 2/5 for Connections)
