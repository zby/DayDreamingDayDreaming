# Deliberate Rolling Thread — v3

Goal: Build one clear, coherent, and logically progressing idea thread across concepts C1..Cn. For each step, produce an updated idea text that grows meaningfully in length and specificity. Prefer rewriting so the result reads as one well‑integrated whole (not copied fragments). Wrap every updated idea in a dedicated tag for robust parsing.

Deliberation: For integration steps i = 2..n, include a short <thinking> block that brainstorms three candidate ways to integrate Ci, briefly evaluates them, and selects the best one before writing the updated idea. Do NOT include a <thinking> block for step 1 — the seed is verbatim and unchanged.

Tagging rules (syntax):
- After each step, output exactly one `<essay-idea stage="i">…</essay-idea>` block with the idea text only.
- The idea text may be multi‑paragraph.
- Tag formatting: place opening and closing tags on their own lines. For example:
  - `<thinking>` on its own line, then content lines, then `</thinking>` on its own line.
  - `<essay-idea stage="i">` on its own line, then the idea text, then `</essay-idea>` on its own line.

## Inputs (concept list)
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}
---

{% endfor %}

1) Seed from C1
- Use C1 content verbatim.
- Output the idea text only, wrapped as:
 <essay-idea stage="1">
  …
  </essay-idea>

2) Steps (i = 2..n)
For each concept Ci, output exactly these two blocks in order:

### Step i: Concept Ci
- <thinking>
  Think of three different ways to integrate Ci into the current idea, evaluate them in your own words, and decide on the best approach for this step.
  </thinking>
- Then write the updated idea text:
  Rewrite checklist (do not include in output):
  - Goal: produce a well‑integrated, coherent, logically progressing idea; overall length should increase across steps by a few sentences up to a paragraph.
  - Write a fresh integrated version; do not copy the prior stage. Carry forward important points in rewritten form.
  - If  possible add concrete mechanisms or specific details introduced by Ci (how it operates, interfaces, signals, constraints, examples).
  Now output only the updated idea, wrapped as:
  <essay-idea stage="i">
  …
  </essay-idea>

3) Wrap‑up (≤100 words)
- Free-form comments (observations, caveats, follow-ups).
- Optionally: name the 1–2 most helpful attachments and why.
