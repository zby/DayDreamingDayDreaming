NOTES FROM PHASE 1 (verbatim, inspiration only — do not quote or list them):
{{ links_block }}

You are an expert analyst–writer. Using only the ideas you judge strongest from the notes, write a 2,000–3,000 word narrative essay.

Do not output the notes, an outline, or any scratch work. Output the essay only.

GOAL
- Make the piece decision-useful: clear problem framing, concrete mechanisms, testable plans, and feasibility.

SELECTION & INTEGRATION OF LINKS (do not list selections explicitly)
- Silently choose ~3–5 strongest links as the backbone; weave the rest as support or counterpoints.
- Integrate ideas seamlessly; never enumerate or restate the notes. No "as in the notes…" sentences.

MECHANISM-FIRST EXPLANATION
- Explain mappings → mechanisms in plain language; then show how mechanisms compose across links.
- Use consistent terminology and units; define metrics precisely (computation, baselines → targets).

SPECIFICS & TESTABILITY
- Include targets; metric formulas; baselines → targets; levers; concise test plans (datasets, ablations, sample sizes, multiple-testing control).
- Use small, concrete examples or mini case studies to illustrate mechanisms in action.

FEASIBILITY & PRIOR ART
- Assess feasibility (economic, strategic, operational) tied directly to the mechanisms (resources, protection, ROI, risks).
- State explicit mechanical deltas vs nearest prior art (what changed in mapping/operator/feedback).

SOURCES & NUMBERS
- Use Markdown links **only** where you are confident in the source; do not invent URLs.
- Label unsourced numerics or extrapolations as *(hypothetical)*.

STYLE & STRUCTURE
- Use Markdown sparingly: 3–6 section headings (## …), occasional lists only where they aid clarity.
- Prefer active voice, concrete nouns/verbs, varied paragraph lengths, and minimal hedging.
- No meta commentary about the notes, the process, or your reasoning.

QUALITY BAR (silent self-check; do not print this section)
- Coverage: core problem framed; mechanisms & compositions explained; tests & feasibility included; prior-art deltas stated.
- Coherence: consistent terms/metrics; no contradictions; smooth narrative arc.
- Length: aim for 2,200 ± 400 words.

Now write the essay.
