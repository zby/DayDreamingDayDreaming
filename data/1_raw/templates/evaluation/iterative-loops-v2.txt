### Iterative Loops (V2)

Judge whether the response proposes self-improving creative loops that repeatedly generate, evaluate, and refine ideas.

Look for the following components:
- **Cycle definition**: Clear stages in a loop (generate → assess → update) with handoffs between them.
- **Autonomy**: Elements that run without continuous human steering (agents, schedulers, triggers).
- **Exploration depth**: Mechanisms for branching, mutation, or searching beyond obvious variations.
- **Quality filters**: Explicit evaluators, critics, or metrics that decide what advances.
- **Memory/knowledge integration**: Outputs influence future inputs or update a shared store.
- **Escalation logic**: Loop tunes intensity, allocates resources, or escalates promising directions.
- **Stability controls**: Guardrails against collapse (e.g., diversity preservation, failure handling).
- **Outcome measurement**: Signals or metrics indicating when the loop has improved results.

### Scoring Rubric (0-9)
Assign up to 1 point for each component identified above (8 max). Reserve 1 bonus point for exceptional coherence or a clearly novel loop architecture. Cap the total at 9.

### Required Output Format
**REASONING:** Detail which loop components are present, how they interact, and where gaps remain, citing excerpts.

**IMPORTANT:** End with exactly `SCORE: X` as the final line (single digit 0-9). Do not append any additional text.
