--- EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS ---

Evaluate this response for style and coherence quality, focusing on how well the writing flows and integrates concepts. Use the scoring rubric below to ensure consistent evaluation.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

### **Coherence & Integration (40% of score)**

**Natural Concept Integration (15 points):**
- **Excellent (13-15)**: Concepts are woven together with clear, logical connections that feel inevitable rather than forced. Each concept serves a specific purpose in the overall framework.
- **Good (10-12)**: Concepts are reasonably well-connected, though some connections may feel somewhat artificial or stretched.
- **Fair (7-9)**: Concepts are connected but the integration feels forced or artificial in places.
- **Poor (4-6)**: Concepts are poorly integrated, with weak or unclear connections between them.
- **Very Poor (1-3)**: Concepts appear to be randomly combined without meaningful integration.

**Logical Flow (15 points):**
- **Excellent (13-15)**: Argument progresses logically from start to finish with each section building naturally on the previous one. Clear cause-and-effect relationships.
- **Good (10-12)**: Argument flows reasonably well with minor gaps or jumps in logic.
- **Fair (7-9)**: Argument has some logical gaps or sections that don't clearly connect.
- **Poor (4-6)**: Argument lacks clear logical progression with significant gaps.
- **Very Poor (1-3)**: Argument is disjointed with no clear logical structure.

**Internal Consistency (10 points):**
- **Excellent (9-10)**: Ideas are perfectly consistent throughout with no contradictions.
- **Good (7-8)**: Ideas are generally consistent with minor inconsistencies.
- **Fair (5-6)**: Some inconsistencies or contradictions that don't severely undermine the argument.
- **Poor (3-4)**: Multiple inconsistencies that significantly weaken the argument.
- **Very Poor (1-2)**: Major contradictions that make the argument incoherent.

### **Writing Quality (35% of score)**

**Clarity (15 points):**
- **Excellent (13-15)**: Writing is crystal clear despite complexity. Technical concepts are explained accessibly.
- **Good (10-12)**: Writing is generally clear with occasional unclear passages.
- **Fair (7-9)**: Writing is somewhat unclear in places, requiring effort to follow.
- **Poor (4-6)**: Writing is often unclear and difficult to follow.
- **Very Poor (1-3)**: Writing is consistently unclear and confusing.

**Engagement & Structure (10 points):**
- **Excellent (9-10)**: Highly engaging with compelling structure that guides the reader effectively.
- **Good (7-8)**: Engaging with good structure that generally guides the reader well.
- **Fair (5-6)**: Somewhat engaging with adequate structure.
- **Poor (3-4)**: Not very engaging with poor structure.
- **Very Poor (1-2)**: Unengaging with very poor structure.

**Depth vs. Verbosity (10 points):**
- **Excellent (9-10)**: Achieves remarkable depth without wasting words. Every sentence serves a purpose.
- **Good (7-8)**: Good depth with minimal unnecessary content.
- **Fair (5-6)**: Adequate depth but some content could be condensed.
- **Poor (3-4)**: Lacks depth or is overly verbose.
- **Very Poor (1-2)**: Very shallow or extremely verbose.

### **Conceptual Honesty (25% of score)**

**Genuine Connections (10 points):**
- **Excellent (9-10)**: Connections between concepts are substantive and well-justified, not superficial.
- **Good (7-8)**: Connections are generally genuine with some that could be stronger.
- **Fair (5-6)**: Some connections feel manufactured or forced.
- **Poor (3-4)**: Many connections feel artificial or poorly justified.
- **Very Poor (1-2)**: Most connections appear to be forced or artificial.

**Avoids Forced Synthesis (10 points):**
- **Excellent (9-10)**: Resists artificial concept cramming. Each concept serves a clear purpose.
- **Good (7-8)**: Generally avoids forced synthesis with minor issues.
- **Fair (5-6)**: Some evidence of forced synthesis or concept cramming.
- **Poor (3-4)**: Clear evidence of forced synthesis in multiple places.
- **Very Poor (1-2)**: Extensive forced synthesis throughout.

**Acknowledges Limitations (5 points):**
- **Excellent (5)**: Thoughtfully addresses limitations, tensions, and challenges.
- **Good (4)**: Acknowledges most limitations and challenges.
- **Fair (3)**: Acknowledges some limitations but misses important ones.
- **Poor (2)**: Minimally acknowledges limitations.
- **Very Poor (1)**: Fails to acknowledge limitations or challenges.

## SCORING GUIDELINES

**For Interdisciplinary Work:**
- **Concept Integration**: When evaluating interdisciplinary work, consider whether the connections between different domains are substantively justified or merely superficial analogies.
- **Metaphorical Reasoning**: Distinguish between meaningful metaphors that illuminate concepts and forced analogies that don't add value.
- **Domain Bridging**: Evaluate whether the work successfully bridges different domains with genuine insights or just lists concepts from different fields.

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- **Buzzword Bingo**: Don't reward responses that just mention concepts without meaningful integration.
- **Superficial Connections**: Look for substantive relationships, not just thematic grouping.
- **Forced Analogies**: Distinguish between helpful metaphors and strained comparisons.

## CALIBRATION EXAMPLES

**Example of Good Integration (Score: 8-9):**
"By combining the Default Mode Network's background processing with economic innovation models, the system creates a structured approach to creativity that mimics human insight while optimizing for efficiency."

**Example of Poor Integration (Score: 3-4):**
"The system uses DMN, economic models, and AI architecture to create innovation." (Just lists concepts without explaining how they work together)

## FINAL SCORE CALCULATION

1. Calculate weighted scores for each section
2. Sum the weighted scores
3. Round to the nearest whole number
4. Ensure the final score reflects the detailed evaluation above

Your evaluation must end with a line containing the final score and there should be no more content.
That last line should have the exact format given below - with X being a placeholder for a digit:

SCORE: X
