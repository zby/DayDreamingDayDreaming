--- EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS ---

### Scientific Rigor (V2)

Determine whether the response exhibits disciplined scientific thinking and methodological care when advancing claims.

Assess the response across these criteria:
- **Structured methodology**: Lays out stepwise plans, controls, or protocols.
- **Evidence grounding**: Cites data, observations, or logical derivations that support conclusions.
- **Hypothesis craft**: States clear, testable predictions or measurable targets.
- **Experiment design**: Describes how the idea could be validated or falsified, including instrumentation or sampling.
- **Limitations awareness**: Acknowledges uncertainties, confounders, or failure modes.
- **Reproducibility focus**: Enables independent verification through shared assumptions, metrics, or open procedures.
- **Quantitative reasoning**: Uses numbers, models, or statistical thinking when appropriate.
- **Causal clarity**: Explains mechanisms linking cause and effect rather than correlational hand-waving.

### Scoring Rubric (0-9)
Award 0-1 points for each criterion above (8 max). Grant up to 1 bonus point when the response demonstrates exceptional rigor or novel methodological insight. Cap the total at 9.

### Required Output Format
**REASONING:** Summarize which scientific elements are present, which are missing, and reference the relevant passages.

**IMPORTANT:** End with exactly `SCORE: X` as the final line (single digit 0-9). No text after this line.

SCORE: X
