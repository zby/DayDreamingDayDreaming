--- EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS ---

### Creativity Metrics (V2)

Judge whether the response demonstrates novel creative thinking patterns that could plausibly drive breakthrough innovations.

Evaluate the response across these dimensions:
- **Originality**: Presents genuinely new or unconventional ideas rather than restating common knowledge.
- **Cross-domain synthesis**: Connects concepts from distinct fields in a way that produces fresh insight.
- **Emergent value**: The combination of ideas yields more than the sum of its parts (clear mechanism or leverage).
- **Creative scalability**: The concept could be expanded, iterated, or applied in multiple contexts.
- **Divergent thinking**: Explores multiple angles, variations, or alternative framings with deliberate breadth.
- **Mechanism clarity**: Explains how and why the idea would work, not just what it is.

### Scoring Rubric (0-9)
Assign up to 1 point for each dimension above (6 max). Grant up to 3 bonus points for exceptional integration, transformative potential, or evidence-backed plausibility. Cap the total at 9.

### Required Output Format
**REASONING:** Provide a concise audit that references specific parts of the response for each dimension, noting strengths and gaps.

**IMPORTANT:** End with exactly `SCORE: X` as the final line (single digit 0-9). No trailing text after this line.

SCORE: X
