## Mechanism Primer (read-once guidance; do not include in essay)
A **Mechanism** is a falsifiable process mapping initial states → outcomes via operators under constraints.
- **Discovery mode:** hypothesized causal/explanatory model → testable predictions.
- **Invention mode:** design/algorithm/protocol → measurable performance.
Minimum bar (both): name state variables; list operators/updates; objectives/metrics; constraints/assumptions; ≥1 lever; ≥1 baseline; ≥1 test (dataset/experiment).

## Structure-Preserving Links (Spine)

For each candidate link, write one self-contained block:

### Link: Concept A → Concept B
- **Link type** (choose one):  
  1) Structure-Preserving Analogy  2) Mechanism Composition  3) Constraint / Objective Import  
  4) Property Transfer / Feature Grafting  5) Domain Reframing / Problem Translation

#### Cross-Domain Mappings (required)
- **State mapping:** …
- **Operator mapping:** …
- **Objective / feedback mapping:** …
- **Constraint mapping:** …
- **Metric mapping:** …
- **Invariant preserved:** (Composition | Monotonicity(+metric) | Constraint Conservation | Symmetry | Fixed Point)
- *(Optional)* **Mapping quality:** Coverage / Consistency / Lossiness (brief)

#### Mechanism (with Feasibility)
- **Mode:** Discovery | Invention
- **Subtype (tags):** pick 0–3 from  
  Metric/Instrument · Evaluation/Protocol · Data/Experiment · Refutation/Bound · Theory/Normal-Form ·  
  Taxonomy/Design-Space · Mechanism-Design/Policy · Safety/Security · Adoption/Moat · Interface/HIL ·  
  Meta-Optimization · Standard/Spec
- **Subtype checks:** (e.g., Metric → reliability & baseline; Protocol → reproducibility & stress suite)
- **Name:** …
- **Inputs:** (data/prior/knowledge graph/signals; constraints/assumptions)
- **State & operators:** (state variables; operators/transforms; update rule/dynamics)
- **Procedure (≤15 steps or pseudocode):**
  1. …
  …
- **Objectives & selection criteria:**
  - *Discovery:* null/alt, effect size(s), thresholds
  - *Invention:* primary metric(s), targets, acceptance criteria
- **Metrics & evaluation plan:**
  - **Metrics:** definitions + computation (e.g., novelty@k, AUROC, ROIC, time-to-parity)
  - **Baselines:** ≥1
  - **Ablations:** levers to vary; expected signatures
  - **Datasets / Experiments:**
    - *Discovery:* datasets, sample size/power, multiple-testing control, prereg
    - *Invention:* benchmark suites, load profiles, safety/reliability checks
- **Levers & constraints:** tunables (e.g., temperature, walk bias, budget); hard constraints (cost, latency, ethics)
- **Assumptions:** explicit premises that must hold
- **Switches (counterfactuals):** toggle → expected signature if true
- **Evidence ledger:**
  - **Evidence so far:** [item | strength: weak/moderate/strong | replicated? yes/no]
  - **Planned evidence:** [next test | decision rule (“advance/drop if …”)]
- **Mapping robustness:** Lossiness […]; Directionality (A→B invertible?); Failure signatures (what metric breaks, how)
- **Feasibility & ops (local to this mechanism):**
  - **Resources:** compute, talent, data, instruments, partners
  - **Protection strategy:** IP/trade-secret, data network effects, moving-target defense
  - **Economic rationale:** ROI driver, moat width, cost-to-replicate
  - **Ops metrics:** time-to-parity, cost curve, market-advantage duration
  - **Human roles (if any):** reviewers/approvers; thresholds they control
  - **IP/Policy constraints:** route (patent/trade secret/defensive pub); compliance/dual-use/export flags
  - **Risks & mitigations:** technical, validation bottlenecks, safety/ethics, policy
  - **Predictions (testable):** ≥2 concrete; time-bound if possible
- **Prior-art delta (local):** nearest neighbor(s) → *mechanical* difference (new mapping/operator/feedback)

#### Gate Criteria (0–2 each; brief justification)
- Specificity: _
- Mechanism clarity: _
- Refutability: _
- Prior-art delta: _
- Feasibility: _
- Ethics/Policy: _
**Gate weights (optional):** {spec:1, mech:1, refute:1, prior:1, feas:1, ethics:1}  
**Weighted total:** X/12 — **Decision:** Pass / Drop

---

*(Optional for chains)* **Composition check (A→B→C):**
- **Deps:** consumes from L_k; outputs to L_j
- **Composed invariant:** [holds / breaks at L_*]
- **Chokepoints:** [link or variable]; mitigation

---

## Link Selection Summary (essay backbone)
- **All Pass links (ranked):** score + one-line rationale each
- **Coverage note:** ensure selected set spans ≥2 subtypes or concept roles (avoid redundancy)
- **Selected links (2–4):** e.g., L1 … (11/12); L3 … (10/12) — these define the essay sections
- **Gate weights used (if non-default):** {…}
- **Dropped but interesting (max 3):** link → reason → revisit-if condition

## Lints (Auto-Checks)
- No outcome-as-operator names: <ok|flag>
- Every link has type + mappings: <ok|flag>
- Neologism guard: any coined term defined + mechanism mapping (state → operator → objective)
- Specificity floor: mention ≥2 of {dataset, objective/loss, evaluation metric, baseline, ablation}
- Repro anchors present: data/code version | compute budget | safety check
- Citations in essay: Markdown links [text](url); unsourced numerics marked (hypothetical)

<essay>
Write a 2,000–3,000 word narrative that:

- Frames the problem/opportunity.
- Follows the **selected links** as the backbone (1 major section per link, in ranked order).
- Explains how the mappings yield mechanisms (plain language) and how mechanisms compose across links.
- Integrates specifics: targets; metric definitions/computations; baselines → targets; levers; concise test plans
  (datasets, ablations, sample sizes, multiple-testing control).
- Discusses feasibility (economic/strategic/operational) **tied to the mechanisms used** (resources, protection, ROI, risks).
- States explicit **mechanical** deltas vs nearest prior art (what changed in mapping/operator/feedback).
- Uses Markdown links for sources; label unsourced numerics as (hypothetical).
Prefer paragraphs; use brief tables only when they aid clarity.
