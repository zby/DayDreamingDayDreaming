# Concept Link Generation — (Streamlined Version)

**Role:** You are an expert in interdisciplinary synthesis and mechanism design.
**Goal:** For a small set of unordered concept pairs, explore link options, **score them**, **pick the best 1–2 per pair**, and provide concise elaboration focused on core insights rather than implementation details.

## Inputs

### The list of concepts:

{% endraw %}
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}
---

{% endfor %}
{% raw %}


### Budgets (suggested)

**Pairs P ≤ 6**, **Options per pair S ≤ 5**, **Final links ≤ 8**.

---

## Global Production Rules

* Consider **unordered pairs {A,B}**; evaluate **both directions** (A→B, B→A).
* Across all *final* links: cover **≥3 different link types**; avoid near-duplicates.
* **Mechanism ≤80 words**, **3–5 steps**, with a **named lever**.
* Focus on conceptual insights rather than detailed implementation.
* Include examples when you can draw on real knowledge or plausible scenarios.
* If numbers are unsourced, mark *(hypothetical)*.

---

## Link Types (pick exactly one per option)

* **Reframing / Problem Translation**
* **Constraint→Objective Import**
* **Mechanism Composition**
* **Feature Graft / Capability Transfer**
* **Structure-Preserving Analogy**

## Output Structure

### A) Pair Explorer (brief; for each unordered pair {A,B})

1. **Pair header:** `Pair {{i}}: {A, B}`

2. **Option Slate (≤5 options, both directions allowed).** Each option is a **stub** (≤4 lines):

   * **ID:** `[{{i}}-{{k}}]`
   * **Type & Direction:** e.g., *Mechanism Composition, A→B*
   * **Causal transfer (1 line):** …
   * **Objective (positive, controllable):** …
   * **Lever (1–3 words):** e.g., *idle-time gating*

3. **Score & Selection (per pair):**

   * **Rate options** considering: *Impact*, *Tractability*, *Clarity*, *Novelty*.
   * **Pick best 1–2 winners** based on overall strength.
   * **Rationale (1 line):** why these win over others.
   * **Winners:** list winning IDs (e.g., `[{{i}}-2], [{{i}}-4]`).

---

### B) Selected Links (expand only winners; one block per winner)

#### Link {{global\_idx}}: A → B

* **Type:** (Reframing | Constraint→Objective | Mechanism Composition | Feature Graft | Structure-Preserving Analogy)
* **Causal transfer:** Because A has **\[lever L]**, we can do **\[operator O]** in B, which causes **\[measurable effect E]**.

##### Core Mechanism (≤80 words, 3–5 steps; name the **lever**)

1. …
2. …
3. …
4. …
5. …
   → **Primary indicator:** What realistic outcomes would look like.

##### Key Insight (≤2 lines)

What's the main conceptual breakthrough or transferable principle?

##### Example (≤2 lines, with numbers when available)

Brief illustration of the mechanism in action. *(hypothetical if unsourced)*

##### One-sentence delta (≤25 words)

Plain-English payoff; no jargon.

## Cross-Domain Patterns

After completing all links, identify **2-3 universal patterns** that emerged across multiple links. What mechanisms or principles appear to work across different domains?

**Pattern 1:** [Name] - [1-2 sentence description]
**Pattern 2:** [Name] - [1-2 sentence description] 
**Pattern 3:** [Name] - [1-2 sentence description]

## Strategic Implications

**For Innovation (≤3 bullets):**
* Key insight for improving discovery/innovation processes
* Key insight for improving discovery/innovation processes
* Key insight for improving discovery/innovation processes

**For Business Strategy (≤3 bullets):**
* Key insight for building competitive advantages
* Key insight for building competitive advantages
* Key insight for building competitive advantages

## Generation Workflow

1. **Choose P unordered pairs {A,B}** with strong link potential.
2. For each pair, **generate Option Slate** of up to S options (mix of types and directions).
3. **Evaluate and select 1–2 winners per pair** based on strength and non-redundancy.
4. **Expand only winners** using streamlined Selected Links format.
5. **Identify cross-domain patterns** and **strategic implications**.
6. **Stop when quota satisfied** and type diversity (≥3 types overall) achieved.

### Notes

* Focus on **conceptual insights** rather than implementation details
* Avoid extensive test plans, risk analysis, or technical specifications
* Emphasize **transferable principles** and **strategic implications**
* Keep mechanisms concise but substantive
