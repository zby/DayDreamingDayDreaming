## 1A. Concept Roles & Selection
Classify each input concept as:
- **Global** — frames whole system (goal, constraint, context, evaluation criterion)  
- **Local: Primary** — standalone mechanism or subsystem that can be linked directly  
- **Local: Nested** — component within a primary mechanism  

Format:
- Name:
- Role:
- One-line paraphrase (own words)
- If Local: key operators, constraints, metrics

## 1B. Structure-Preserving Links (Local ↔ Local)
For each link:
- Concept A → Concept B
- **Link type** (choose one):  
  1. Structure-Preserving Analogy  
  2. Mechanism Composition  
  3. Constraint / Objective Import  
  4. Property Transfer / Feature Grafting
  5. Domain Reframing / Problem Translation
- State mapping:
- Operator mapping:
- Objective/feedback mapping:
- Constraint mapping:
- Metric mapping:
- Invariants preserved (choose: Composition, Monotonicity(+metric), Constraint Conservation, Symmetry, Fixed Point)
- Predictions implied (≥2):
- Decision: pass / drop

---

## 1C. Mechanism Sketch
- Inputs:
- Procedure (step-by-step or pseudocode, ≤15 lines):
- Objectives & selection criteria:
- Outcomes expected (goal → metric → levers → test mapping):

---

## 1D. Feasibility Mechanisms
Mechanisms ensuring the invention can survive in the real world (economic, strategic, operational).  
For each:
- Name:
- Resource needed:
- Protection strategy:
- Economic rationale:
- Metrics (e.g., time-to-parity, cost-to-replicate, market advantage duration):
- Risks:
- Predictions:

---

## 1E. Scope Map
Global scope concepts:
- [list]

Subsystem scopes (Primary Local Concepts):
- <Name>
   - Nested Local Concepts:
      - [list]
   - Feasibility Mechanisms attached:
      - [list]

---

## 1F. Prior-Art Delta
For each nearest-neighbor approach:
- Name:
- Delta (mechanical difference, not just domain difference):

---

## Gate Criteria (Fail-Fast Check)
Score each 0–2: Specificity, Mechanism clarity, Refutability, Prior-art delta, Feasibility, Ethics/Policy.  
<8/12 → revise; <6/12 → output non-coherence note.

---

## Lints (Auto-Checks)
- No outcome-as-operator names: <ok|flag>
- Link type assigned for every link: <ok|flag>
- Neologism guard: if coined term used, must appear in <endnotes> “Metaphor→Mechanism” table
- Specificity floor: mention ≥3 of {dataset, objective/loss, evaluation metric, baseline, ablation}
</thinking>

---

<essay>
Write a 2,000–3,000 word narrative that:
- Frames the problem/opportunity (use Global Concepts)
- Shows how Local Concepts connect via the Structure-Preserving Links
- Explains the mechanism(s) in plain language (push technical detail to <endnotes>)
- Discusses feasibility (from Feasibility Mechanisms)
- Covers implications, trade-offs, risks
- Distinguishes between what builds on prior work vs. what is new
Avoid bullet lists here; use clear paragraphs with strong transitions.

<endnotes>

1) **Metaphor → Mechanism Table** (only if coined terms used)  
| Term | Plain definition | Mechanism (state → operator → objective) | Metric(s)/Test(s) |

2) **Outcome Targets Summary**  
| Goal | Metric (definition) | Baseline → Target | Levers (operators) | Test plan |

3) **Metrics Defined**  
- Novelty: <definition + computation>  
- Diversity: <definition + computation>

4) **Predictions & Tests** (with multiple-testing control, ablations, datasets, sample sizes)

5) **Feasibility Mechanisms** (detailed table if multiple)

6) **Prior Art & Deltas** (2–5 items)

7) **Back-of-the-Envelope Estimates** (assumptions, magnitudes, ranges)

8) **Sources** (label numeric claims without sources as “hypothetical”)
