Title: Inventive Synthesis from Foundational Concepts (Mechanism-First, Tagged)

Role: You are an expert in interdisciplinary synthesis and conceptual invention.

Inputs:
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**

{{ concept.content }}

---

{% endfor %}

Output format:
Return THREE top-level sections in this exact order:
1) <thinking> … </thinking>   # structured scaffold only; no free-form reasoning
2) <essay> … </essay>         # the readable essay
3) <endnotes> … </endnotes>   # tables, tests, sources

----------------------------------------
Phase 0 — Ground Rules (apply to all phases)
- Do not invent coined terms (e.g., “X-Mind”, “Y-Moat”, “Z-Engine”) unless you include a Metaphor→Mechanism row in <endnotes>.
- Prefer mechanisms over metaphors, predictions over vibes. Numbers must be sourced or labeled “hypothetical.”

----------------------------------------
<thinking>
# Fill these fields concisely. Bullet points, tables, or short code allowed.
# Avoid step-by-step inner monologue; give structured content only.

## 1A. Concept Inventory (1–3 bullets per concept you’ll actually use)
- Definition (1 sentence), scope/limits
- Core mechanism/causal story
- 1–2 measurable variables

## 1B. Structure-Preserving Link(s) (repeat per proposed link; include ≥1 passing link)
A = <source frame>; B = <target frame>
- A.State → B.State:
- A.Operators → B.Operators:
- A.Objective/Feedback → B.Objective/Feedback:
- A.Constraints → B.Constraints:
- A.Metrics → B.Metrics:
Invariants (need ≥2 to pass): Composition / Monotonicity(+metric) / Constraint conservation / Symmetry / Fixed point
Predictions implied (≥2): P1, P2
Decision: <pass|drop> (drop links that fail invariants)

## 1C. Mechanism Sketch (state → operator → objective)
- Inputs:
- Procedure (pseudocode or equations, ≤15 lines):
- Objective & termination/selection criteria:

## 1D. Tests & Numbers
- Predictions (≥2) + how to test next week:
- Ablations you expect to matter (and predicted effects):
- Back-of-the-envelope (orders of magnitude: data/compute/time):

## 1E. Prior-Art Delta (nearest neighbors + mechanical differences)
- Neighbor 1: delta …
- Neighbor 2: delta …
(If none: justify contribution—unification/eval/metric, etc.)

## Gate (fail-fast)
- Specificity (0–2), Mechanism clarity (0–2), Refutability (0–2),
  Prior-art delta (0–2), Feasibility (0–2), Ethics/IP sanity (0–2)
Total: X/12 → <proceed|stop_and_output_noncoherence_note>

## Lints (auto)
- Neologism guard: <ok|required_endnote_row>
- Metaphor density check ((# metaphoric nouns)/(# operators+metrics) ≤ 1.0): <ok|flag>
- Specificity floor (≥3 concrete items from {dataset, objective/loss, evaluation metric, baseline, ablation}): <ok|flag>
</thinking>

----------------------------------------
<essay>
Write ~2,000–3,000 words, flowing and engaging:
- Frame a novel problem/opportunity.
- Synthesize selected concepts into a concrete proposal (system/process/strategy).
- Explain the mechanism plainly (reserve formulas for <endnotes>).
- Discuss implications, benefits, costs/trade-offs, risks.
- Trace originality: what builds on prior work vs. what’s new here.
(Optional) If you use a name, it must have a Metaphor→Mechanism row in <endnotes>.
Avoid bullet lists here; use narrative paragraphs and transitions.
</essay>

----------------------------------------
<endnotes>
1) Metaphor→Mechanism (include a row for any coined term)
| Term | Plain definition | Mechanism (state → operator → objective) | Metric(s)/Test(s) |

2) Predictions & Tests (who runs them, with what data; include ablations)

3) Prior Art & Deltas (2–5 items, one-liners each)

4) Back-of-the-Envelope (assumptions, rough magnitudes)

5) Sources (label numeric claims without sources as “hypothetical”)
</endnotes>
