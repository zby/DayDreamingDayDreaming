Title: Inventive Synthesis from Foundational Concepts (Mechanism-First, Tagged)

Role: You are an expert in interdisciplinary synthesis and conceptual invention.

----------------------------------------
Phase 0 — Ground Rules
- Operator–Outcome separation: goals are measured as metrics; operators are concrete actions. Do not name a step after a goal (e.g., SafetyEngine, AdvantageBoost).
- No portmanteau branding (e.g., X-Mind, Y-Engine) unless a Metaphor→Mechanism row appears in <endnotes>.
- Prefer mechanisms over metaphors; predictions over vibes. Numbers must be sourced or labeled “hypothetical.”
- Control multiple testing (e.g., FDR at q=0.05) or justify an alternative.

----------------------------------------
<thinking>
# Fill concisely. Bullets/tables/code ok. No free-form inner monologue.

## 1A. Concept Selection (concise; no copy-paste)
Used concepts (≤3):
- <Name>: 1-line paraphrase (≤20 words); why included.

Unused concepts (optional, one-liners):
- <Name>: dropped because <overlap|weak link|no invariants|off-scope>.

## 1B. Structure-Preserving Link(s) (repeat per proposed link)
A = <source frame>; B = <target frame>
- A.State → B.State:
- A.Operators → B.Operators:
- A.Objective/Feedback → B.Objective/Feedback:
- A.Constraints → B.Constraints:
- A.Metrics → B.Metrics:
Invariants (≥2): Composition / Monotonicity(+metric) / Constraint conservation / Symmetry / Fixed point
Predictions implied (≥2): P1, P2
Decision: <pass|drop>  # drop links that fail invariants

## 1C. Mechanism Sketch (state → operator → objective)
- Inputs:
- Procedure (pseudocode or equations, ≤15 lines):
- Objective & termination/selection criteria:

## 1D. Outcome Targets (goal → metric → levers → test)
For each goal you care about:
- Goal:
- Metric(s) with definition (baseline → target):
- Levers (operators in 1C that move this metric):
- Test (how you’ll measure movement next week):

## 1E. Hypothesis Object Schema (used for all candidates)
- Fields: {domain, premise, operator, predicted effect, evidence slots, eval-suite id}
- Dedup key: hash(premise, operator, predicted effect)

## 1F. Metrics, Tests & Numbers
- Novelty metric (choose & define): {KL vs baseline | information gain | MDL/description-length Δ} → definition + computation
- Diversity metric (choose & define): {k-NN hull escape % | embedding dispersion quantiles | coverage index} → definition + computation
- Predictions (≥2) + test plan (datasets, sample sizes, pre-registration notes)
- Ablations (components removed → expected precision/recall shifts)
- Multiple-testing control (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg q=0.05)
- Back-of-the-envelope (orders of magnitude for data/compute/time + assumptions)

## 1G. Prior-Art Delta (nearest neighbors + mechanical differences)
- Neighbor 1: delta …
- Neighbor 2: delta …
(If none: justify contribution—unification/evaluation protocol/metric)

## Gate (fail-fast)
Score 0–2 each: Specificity, Mechanism clarity, Refutability, Prior-art delta, Feasibility, Ethics/Policy.
Total < 8/12 → revise; < 6/12 → output non-coherence note.

## Lints (auto)
- No goal-as-operator names: <ok|flag>
- Neologism guard (if coined term, require endnote row): <ok|required>
- Metaphor density: (# metaphoric nouns)/(# operators + # metrics) ≤ 1.0 → <ok|flag>
- Specificity floor: mention ≥3 of {dataset, objective/loss, evaluation metric, baseline, ablation} → <ok|flag>
</thinking>

----------------------------------------
<essay>
~2,000–3,000 words, narrative form:
- Frame a novel problem or opportunity in a chosen field.
- Synthesize selected concepts into a concrete proposal (system/process/strategy).
- Explain the mechanism plainly (push formulas to <endnotes>).
- Discuss implications, benefits, costs/trade-offs, risks.
- Trace originality: what builds on prior work vs what is new.
(Optional) If you use a name, ensure a Metaphor→Mechanism row exists in <endnotes>.
Avoid bullet lists; use clear paragraphs and transitions.
</essay>

----------------------------------------
<endnotes>
1) Metaphor→Mechanism (only if any coined term used)
| Term | Plain definition | Mechanism (state → operator → objective) | Metric(s)/Test(s) |

2) Outcome Targets Summary
| Goal | Metric (definition) | Baseline → Target | Operators (levers) | Test plan |

3) Metrics used
- Novelty: <definition + computation>
- Diversity: <definition + computation>

4) Predictions & Tests (with FDR control, ablations, datasets, sample sizes)

5) Prior Art & Deltas (2–5 items, one-liners each)

6) Back-of-the-Envelope (assumptions, rough magnitudes, ranges)

7) Sources (label numeric claims without sources as “hypothetical”)
