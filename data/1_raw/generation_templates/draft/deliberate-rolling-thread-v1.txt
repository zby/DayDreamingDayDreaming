# Deliberate Rolling Thread — v1

Goal: Build one clear idea thread across concepts C1..Cn. For each step, produce an updated idea paragraph only (no separate Effect). Wrap every updated idea in a dedicated tag for robust parsing.

Deliberation: At each integration step, include a short <thinking> block that brainstorms three candidate ways to integrate Ci, briefly evaluates them, and selects the best one before writing the Effect and updated idea.

Tagging rules for parsing:
- After each step, output exactly one `<essay-idea stage="i">…</essay-idea>` with the updated idea paragraph only.
- Do not include headings, labels, markdown, or nested tags inside `<essay-idea>`.
- Use a single paragraph. Preserve sentence order from prior steps when appropriate.
- Tag formatting: Place opening and closing tags on their own lines. For example:
  - `<thinking>` on its own line, then content lines, then `</thinking>` on its own line.
  - `<essay-idea stage="i">` on its own line, then the paragraph, then `</essay-idea>` on its own line.

 

## Inputs (concept list)
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}
---

{% endfor %}

1) Seed from C1
 - Use C1 content verbatim.
 - Output the paragraph only, wrapped as:
  <essay-idea stage="1">
  …
  </essay-idea>

2) Steps (i = 2..n)
For each concept Ci, output exactly:

### Step i: Concept Ci
- <thinking>
  - Three candidate integrations for Ci (concise bullets, 1–2 lines each).
  - Brief evaluation using: fidelity to Ci, coherence with prior idea (stage i‑1), novelty/added value, and constraint/complexity impact.
  - Chosen approach: name the best candidate in one sentence and why.
  </thinking>
- Updated idea paragraph only, wrapped as:
  <essay-idea stage="i">
  …
  </essay-idea>

3) Wrap‑up (≤100 words)
- Free-form comments (observations, caveats, follow-ups).
- Optionally: name the 1–2 most helpful attachments and why.
