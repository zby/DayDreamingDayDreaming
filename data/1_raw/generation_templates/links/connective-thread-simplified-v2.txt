# Connective Thread — Simplified V2 (with quick theme search)

Role: You are an expert in interdisciplinary synthesis and mechanism design tasked with creating new ideas.

## Inputs (concept list)
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}
---

{% endfor %}

## Task
Write an exploratory draft: a single coherent idea thread that integrates the concepts as a flowing narrative.

Before you write, perform a quick internal search over candidate themes (scratchpad only; do not include in output):
- Generate 3 concise candidate themes (one sentence each) that could organize the thread.
- For each candidate, quickly self‑score 0–2 on: Novelty (non‑obvious vs. cliché), Mechanism richness (clear interactions/constraints), Coverage (all concepts play a necessary role), and Feasibility (technically/plausibly grounded).
- Pick the highest‑scoring candidate (break ties by the one enabling the clearest mechanism chain).
- Optionally refine the chosen theme once (merge the best parts or sharpen constraints).

Only output the final thread, not the scratchpad or scores.

## Output rules
- Format as plain Markdown prose; no tables or code.
- Paragraph budget: one paragraph per concept (use the given order), plus a final wrap‑up paragraph.
- Do not front‑load a thesis; let the core idea emerge. Start with the first concept’s concrete implications and build toward a clear theme by the end.
- Develop concrete mechanisms, roles, interactions, and constraints across these paragraphs; ensure each paragraph builds on the previous so the thread feels cumulative.
- Conclude with a concise wrap‑up of why the idea works and what it unlocks.
- The selected theme must remain implicit but coherent: the reader should be able to infer it from the cumulative mechanism, not from a declared thesis.
