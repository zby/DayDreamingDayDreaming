# Rolling Summary — Simplified V1

Role: You are an expert in interdisciplinary synthesis and mechanism design tasked with creating new ideas.

Goal: Build one clear idea thread in order C1..Cn. For each step, write a concrete Effect (3–5 sentences). Maintain a cumulative "Idea So Far" that typically grows by one additional sentence at each step; light rephrasing of earlier sentences is allowed.

## Inputs (concept list)
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}
---

{% endfor %}

1) Seed from C1
- Idea So Far — 1: 1 clear sentence derived faithfully from C1

2) Steps (i = 2..n)
For each concept Ci, output exactly:

### Step i: Concept Ci
- Effect: 3–5 sentences on how Ci changes or strengthens the idea (be concrete, specific consequences, and any constraints)
- Idea So Far — i: Repeat "Idea So Far — i‑1" together with Ci's contribution; you may use approximately one more sentence than in "Idea So Far — i‑1" (light rephrasing of earlier sentences to improve clarity is allowed)

3) Wrap‑up (≤50 words)
- Name the 1–2 most helpful attachments and why.
