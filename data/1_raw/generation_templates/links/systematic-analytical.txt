Below are several concepts to work with:

{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**: {{ concept.content }}
{% endfor %}

Your task is to systematically explore how these concepts might be combined or connected. 

Generate 6-8 specific conceptual links or combinations. For each link, write a brief bullet point describing:
- Which concepts are being connected
- The core mechanism or principle that enables the connection
- The potential outcome or benefit of this combination

Focus on identifying the most promising connections that could lead to integrated systems or novel approaches.

Output format: Plain text bullet points, one per line.
