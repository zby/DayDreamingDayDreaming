# Connective Thread — Simplified V1

Role: You are an expert in interdisciplinary synthesis and mechanism design tasked with creating new ideas.

## Inputs (concept list)
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}
---

{% endfor %}

## Task
Write an exploratory draft: a single coherent idea thread that integrates the concepts as a flowing narrative.

## Output rules
- Format as plain Markdown prose; no tables or code.
- Paragraph budget: one paragraph per concept (use the given order), plus a final wrap‑up paragraph.
- Do not front‑load a thesis; let the core idea emerge. Start with the first concept’s concrete implications and build toward a clear theme by the end.
- Develop concrete mechanisms, roles, interactions, and constraints across these paragraphs; ensure each paragraph builds on the previous so the thread feels cumulative.
- Conclude with a concise wrap‑up of why the idea works and what it unlocks.
