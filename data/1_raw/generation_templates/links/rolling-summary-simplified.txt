# Rolling Summary — Simplified

Goal: Build one clear idea thread in order C1..Cn. Keep outputs to single lines.

0) Inputs (names only)
- {% for concept in concepts %}{{ concept.name }}{% if not loop.last %}\n- {% endif %}{% endfor %}

1) Seed from C1
- Idea So Far — 1: one line derived faithfully from C1

Link types (choose one each step):
- Mechanism Composition | Constraint → Objective Import | Property Transfer / Feature Grafting | Structure‑Preserving Analogy | Domain Reframing / Problem Translation

2) Steps (i = 2..n)
For each concept Ci, output exactly:

### Step i: Concept Ci
- Link type: <name>
- Effect: one line on how Ci changes the idea
- Idea So Far — i: one line summary after attaching Ci

3) Wrap‑up (≤50 words)
- Name the 1–2 most helpful attachments and why.
