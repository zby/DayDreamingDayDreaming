Here are some concepts for creative exploration:

{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**: {{ concept.content }}
{% endfor %}

Your task is to let your imagination flow and consider unexpected ways these concepts might combine.

Generate 6-10 innovative conceptual links that show how these concepts could be combined in novel ways. For each link, write a brief bullet point describing:
- Which concepts are being combined
- The novel mechanism or unexpected connection you've identified
- What emergent properties or behaviors might arise from this combination

Focus on truly creative, non-obvious connections that could lead to innovative systems.

Output format: Plain text bullet points, one per line.
