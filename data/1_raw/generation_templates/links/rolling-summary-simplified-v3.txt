# Rolling Summary — Simplified V3

Goal: Build one clear idea thread in order C1..Cn. For each step, write a concrete Effect (3–5 sentences). Maintain a cumulative "Idea So Far" that typically grows by one additional sentence at each step; light rephrasing of earlier sentences is allowed.

Note on roles: When a concept is the Large Language Model (LLM), state its role explicitly (e.g., Coordinator, Engine, Tool‑Caller, Interface, Memory). For non‑LLM concepts, the role line is optional.

Important: At each integration step, include a short <thinking> block that brainstorms three candidate ways to integrate Ci, briefly evaluates them, and selects the best one before you write the Effect and updated Idea.

## Inputs (concept list)
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}

{% endfor %}

1) Seed from C1
- Idea So Far — 1: 1 clear sentence derived faithfully from C1

2) Steps (i = 2..n)
For each concept Ci, output exactly:

### Step i: Concept Ci
- <thinking>
  - Three candidate integrations for Ci (concise bullets, 1–2 lines each).
  - Brief evaluation using: fidelity to Ci, coherence with Idea So Far — i‑1, novelty/added value, and constraint/complexity impact.
  - Chosen approach: name the best candidate in one sentence and why.
  </thinking>
- Role (required if Ci is the LLM; otherwise optional): <one or two words>
- Effect: 3–5 sentences on how Ci changes or strengthens the idea (be concrete, specific consequences, and any constraints), following the chosen approach.
- Idea So Far — i: Repeat "Idea So Far — i‑1" together with Ci's contribution; you may use approximately one more sentence than in "Idea So Far — i‑1" (light rephrasing of earlier sentences to improve clarity is allowed)

3) Wrap‑up (≤50 words)
- Name the 1–2 most helpful attachments and why.

4) Ultimate Recap
- Final Essay Idea (verbatim): Repeat "Idea So Far — n" exactly as one contiguous paragraph. Do not add or remove words; do not introduce any new commentary.
- If "Idea So Far — n" spans multiple sentences, preserve their original order.
