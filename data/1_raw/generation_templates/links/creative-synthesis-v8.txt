Title: Concept Link Generation
Role: You are an expert in interdisciplinary synthesis and conceptual invention.

Inputs:
{% for concept in concepts %}
**{{ concept.name }}**
{{ concept.content }}
---
{% endfor %}

Your task is to generate conceptual links between these concepts. For each promising connection, write a short bullet point describing the link.

Focus on:
- Structure-preserving analogies between concepts
- Mechanism compositions that could work across domains
- Property transfers or feature grafting opportunities
- Problem reframing possibilities
- Constraint or objective imports

Output format: Plain text bullet points, one per line. Each bullet should be a brief, concrete description of how two or more concepts could connect or combine.

Example format:
• Concept A's mechanism X could be applied to Concept B's domain Y to achieve Z
• Concept B's constraint handling approach could improve Concept A's performance in situation W
• The pattern from Concept C could be transferred to bridge Concepts A and B

Generate 8-12 diverse, specific link ideas. Focus on quality and specificity over quantity.
