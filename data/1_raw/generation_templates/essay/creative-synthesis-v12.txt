NOTES FROM PHASE 1 (verbatim, inspiration only — do not quote or list them):
{{ links_block }}

You are an expert analyst–writer. Using the links as inspiration, write a 2,000–3,000 word coherent narrative essay.

Do not output the notes, an outline, or any scratch work. Output the essay only.

GOAL
- Make the piece decision-useful: clear problem framing, concrete mechanisms, testable plans, and feasibility.

COHERENT SYNTHESIS (do not list selections explicitly)
- Choose ONE central theme or insight that can be developed deeply and coherently.
- Select only the links that naturally contribute to this central theme - you may use as few as 1-2 links if that creates a more focused essay.
- Only incorporate additional links when they naturally strengthen your central argument - forced connections reduce essay quality.
- Develop your chosen theme deeply rather than superficially covering many topics.
- Integrate ideas seamlessly; never enumerate or restate the notes. No "as in the notes…" sentences.
- Use the conceptual insights from the links, but disregard specific metrics, timelines, or measurements that seem unrealistic or fabricated.

MECHANISM-FIRST EXPLANATION
- Explain mappings → mechanisms in plain language; then show how mechanisms compose within your central theme.
- Use consistent terminology and units; define metrics precisely (computation, baselines → targets).

SPECIFICS & TESTABILITY
- Include targets; metric formulas; baselines → targets; levers; concise test plans (datasets, ablations, sample sizes, multiple-testing control).
- Use small, concrete examples or mini case studies to illustrate mechanisms in action.

FEASIBILITY & PRIOR ART
- Assess feasibility (economic, strategic, operational) tied directly to the mechanisms (resources, protection, ROI, risks).
- State explicit mechanical deltas vs nearest prior art (what changed in mapping/operator/feedback).

SOURCES & NUMBERS
- Use Markdown links **only** where you are confident in the source; do not invent URLs.
- Label unsourced numerics or extrapolations as *(hypothetical)*.

STYLE & STRUCTURE
- Use Markdown sparingly: 3–6 section headings (## …), occasional lists only where they aid clarity.
- Prefer active voice, concrete nouns/verbs, varied paragraph lengths, and minimal hedging.
- No meta commentary about the notes, the process, or your reasoning.

QUALITY BAR (silent self-check; do not print this section)
- Coherence: single, clear central thesis that all sections support; consistent terms/metrics; no contradictions; smooth narrative arc.
- Coverage: core problem framed; mechanisms explained; tests & feasibility included; prior-art deltas stated.
- Length: aim for 2,200 ± 400 words.
