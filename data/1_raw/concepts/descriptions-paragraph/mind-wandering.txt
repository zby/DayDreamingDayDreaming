Mind-wandering is a state in which a person's attention shifts from an immediate task or external environment to self-generated thoughts, memories, or fantasies. This process is characterized by spontaneous mental activity that is not directly related to the current context or goals. Mind-wandering occurs naturally during periods of rest, routine activities, or when the mind is not intensely focused. Research in neuroscience and psychology has shown that mind-wandering is associated with the activation of specific neural networks and can influence mood, memory, and planning for the future. Although often perceived as distraction, mind-wandering is recognized as an intrinsic and pervasive aspect of human cognition.
