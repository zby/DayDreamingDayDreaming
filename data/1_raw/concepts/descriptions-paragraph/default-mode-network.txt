The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a large-scale brain network that is most active when the brain is in a state of wakeful rest, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering. The DMN is associated with internal thoughts, remembering the past, planning for the future, and creativity. The idea of an AI having a similar "default mode" for exploring its knowledge base is a direct inspiration for creating systems that can engage in background creative processing.
