The flywheel effect refers to a selfâ€‘reinforcing dynamic in which effort and results accumulate to create momentum, so that each incremental gain reduces relative friction and makes subsequent progress easier. The term comes from the mechanical flywheel, which stores rotational energy and smooths power delivery. In organizational, product, and market contexts, flywheels arise when activities are linked by positive feedback (for example, improvements that attract participants, whose participation improves the offering, which attracts more participants). Effective flywheels depend on low friction at handoffs, consistent inputs, and alignment of incentives; they can stall when friction increases, inputs diminish, or feedback turns negative.
