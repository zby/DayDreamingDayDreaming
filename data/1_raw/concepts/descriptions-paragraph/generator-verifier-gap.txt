This concept highlights the fundamental difference in difficulty between generating a new idea and verifying its quality. It is often much easier to recognize a good idea than to come up with one from scratch, a phenomenon observed across many domains from mathematics to creative arts. This insight inspires a two-part system in AI, with a "generator" component that produces many ideas (including potentially absurd ones) and a "verifier" or "critic" component that filters them for quality, coherence, and usefulness.
