Adversarial evaluation is a structured method of assessment where one entity produces proposals or solutions, and another entity critically tests or challenges those outputs. The process involves an ongoing interaction: the producer attempts to meet or surpass certain standards, while the evaluator aims to identify flaws, weaknesses, or errors. This competitive dynamic is used in contexts such as games, legal systems, security testing, and organizational decision-making. By continuously challenging and refining proposals through critical review, adversarial evaluation can enhance quality, resilience, and robustness in outcomes, encouraging a higher standard of performance and reliability.
