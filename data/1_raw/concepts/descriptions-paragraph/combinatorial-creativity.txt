Combinatorial creativity refers to the generation of new ideas, products, or expressions by rearranging or merging existing elements in original ways. Rather than inventing wholly new concepts, this process relies on the recombination of familiar knowledge, materials, or experiences to create outcomes that are both novel and useful. This form of creativity is seen across language, art, technology, and science, where breakthroughs often stem from unexpected juxtapositions or integrations. The principle underscores the generative potential inherent in bringing together parts from different domains, highlighting the importance of diversity and variety in fostering innovation.
