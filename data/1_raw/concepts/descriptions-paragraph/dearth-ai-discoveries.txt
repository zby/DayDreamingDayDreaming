Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, there is a widely acknowledged shortage of major scientific or conceptual breakthroughs generated autonomously by AI systems. While tools like AlphaFold have produced notable results in protein folding (Jumper et al., 2021), systematic reviews find that truly novel discoveries directly originating from AI remain rare. For example, a 2023 Nature survey of over 2,000 machine learningâ€“based scientific papers reported fewer than 1% involving AI-generated, previously unknown insights (Hutson, 2023). Analysts note that, outside tightly defined domains, most AI advances involve automation or recombination rather than new foundational knowledge (Marcus, 2022). This ongoing gap is seen as a major unsolved challenge in AI research.
