Despite impressive achievements in areas like game playing and pattern recognition, AI has so far fallen short of making truly groundbreaking, independent discoveries. Current AI is excellent at solving problems defined by humans and exploring known data, but it struggles to formulate new questions or identify "unknown unknowns" â€“ problems we don't even know exist. This limitation highlights the need for AI systems that can go beyond their training data and engage in more creative, exploratory "thought" to generate genuinely novel ideas, much like a human daydreaming.
