An economic moat refers to a business's sustainable competitive advantage that protects it from rivals and preserves long-term profitability. Coined and popularized by investor Warren Buffett, the metaphor describes the structural features—such as strong brand, proprietary technology, regulatory protection, network effects, or cost advantages—that create durable barriers to entry in a market. An effective economic moat makes it difficult for competitors to erode a company's market share or undercut its profits. The concept is fundamental in investment analysis and corporate strategy, guiding the search for businesses that can maintain superior returns over extended periods, even in the face of competition and industry change.
