Combinatorial search is a method of searching for solutions by systematically exploring combinations of possibilities. In the context of AI daydreaming, it refers to the idea of the AI searching through its vast store of knowledge and skills to find new and useful combinations. Unlike traditional search algorithms that look for specific solutions, this approach involves open-ended exploration of the combinatorial space of ideas, potentially discovering unexpected connections and novel insights.
