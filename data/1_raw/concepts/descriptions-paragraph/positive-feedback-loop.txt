A positive feedback loop is a self-reinforcing process where the output of a system amplifies or accelerates the input, creating a cycle that grows stronger over time. In positive feedback, changes in one direction trigger further changes in the same direction, leading to exponential growth, escalation, or amplification. This contrasts with negative feedback loops, which provide stability through corrective responses. Positive feedback loops are fundamental to many phenomena in nature, technology, economics, and social systemsâ€”from population explosions and chain reactions to viral growth and market bubbles. While they can drive rapid progress and innovation, positive feedback loops can also lead to instability, runaway effects, or system collapse if left unchecked, making their understanding crucial for managing complex systems.
