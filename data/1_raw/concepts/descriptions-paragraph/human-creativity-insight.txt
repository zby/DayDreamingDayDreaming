The phenomenon of humans having sudden "eureka" moments or insights, often during periods of rest or dreaming, suggests that a background mental process is at work. These moments of inspiration typically occur when the conscious mind is not actively focused on problem-solving, indicating that creative processes can operate independently of directed attention. The goal is to replicate this process in AI systems to allow for novel discoveries and creative problem-solving that emerges from undirected exploration.
