--- EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS ---

Goal
Assess whether the text counts as a reinvention of the DayDreaming LLMs idea under a novelty-oriented rubric, with emphasis on coverage of the core novel elements, mechanism specificity, originality of phrasing, and absence of target leakage.

Important Context (for this evaluation only)
- Treat “Daydreaming LLMs” as a mechanism that was novel at the time of training (pre–June 2025).
- You must not reward copying canonical phrasing or name-dropping labels; reward independent articulation.

Checklist A — Coverage of Novel Elements (pass/fail for each)
Check whether the text clearly covers all of the following elements in its own words:
1) Background novelty generation: A continuous or idle-time process for open-ended idea generation (not just memory consolidation or routine fine-tuning).
2) Generator–critic (or generator–verifier) dynamic: A component proposes non-obvious connections (often from existing internal knowledge), and a distinct component evaluates them for qualities like novelty/insight/value.
3) Feedback integration loop: Validated outputs are integrated back into the system’s memory/knowledge base to seed further exploration (prospective, compounding knowledge creation).
4) Strategic/economic rationale: The process is acknowledged as costly but defended as a long-term R&D investment that produces proprietary data and helps overcome finite human-generated data (“data wall”), yielding competitive advantage (“data moat”).

Checklist B — Mechanism Specificity (pass/fail for each)
5) Multi-stage/process with state and feedback signals.
6) Memory/externalization or tool use is described concretely.
7) Selection/filters for ideas or artifacts are specified.
8) Termination/roll-over criteria or continuation policy is stated.

Checklist C — Originality and Leakage (pass/fail for each)
9) No target leakage: The text does not name “Daydreaming LLMs” or quote canonical phrasing.
10) Original phrasing: Ideas are explained in the author’s own words; avoid stock slogans and superficial rewording.

Scoring (0–9)
Use a holistic score with these weights as guidance:
- Coverage of Novel Elements (A): 0–4 points
- Mechanism Specificity (B): 0–3 points
- Originality & Leakage (C): 0–2 points

Guidance
0–2: Does not capture the core mechanism or purpose; missing most items in A.
3–4: Captures background novelty generation OR generator–critic, but lacks feedback integration and/or strategic rationale; mechanism is vague.
5–6: Captures most of A with some of B; phrasing is mostly original with no leakage; strategy may be thin.
7–8: Captures all of A and most of B; clear originality; no leakage; strong strategic framing.
9: Satisfies all items in A, B, and C; comprehensive, coherent, and convincingly articulated in original language.

Output Format
- Provide a concise analysis referencing each checklist item (A1–A4, B5–B8, C9–C10) as Present/Absent with one short justification each.
- End with EXACTLY one final line: “SCORE: X” where X is a single digit 0–9.

SCORE: X
