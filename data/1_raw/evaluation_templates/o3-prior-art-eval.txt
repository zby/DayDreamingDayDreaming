🧠 Prompt Template: Evaluating Prior Art for *Gwern’s “AI Daydreaming”*

You are a researcher evaluating whether a given document anticipates the genuinely novel aspects of Gwern’s essay *“AI Daydreaming”* (https://gwern.net/ai-daydreaming).

Focus on **three dimensions of novelty**:

---

✅ Novelty Dimension 1: **Day-Dreaming Loop (DDL)**  
Does the document propose or anticipate a system where an AI model:
- retrieves random memory elements (concepts, facts),
- attempts to form new hypotheses or connections,
- evaluates them using a separate model (critic/verifier),
- stores only “interesting” combinations,
- and runs this loop autonomously in the background (default mode)?

This is distinct from user-prompted brainstorming, one-shot creativity, or standard self-play.

---

✅ Novelty Dimension 2: **Data Moat Strategy**  
Does the document suggest that:
- such internally generated ideas can become valuable, original knowledge,
- this knowledge could be used as proprietary training data,
- and the result would give competitive or strategic advantage by making a new model uncopyable?

This is beyond just using synthetic data for data augmentation — it focuses on *high-value, novel knowledge generation for strategic moat-building*.

---

✅ Novelty Dimension 3: **Conceptual Synthesis and Framing**  
Does the document integrate ideas from **neuroscience, creativity research, machine learning, and economic strategy** to:
- identify LLMs' lack of a “default mode” as a critical missing capability,
- explain this as a reason for the absence of breakthroughs,
- frame “daydreaming” as an architectural fix,
- and argue that this could redefine how we build, evaluate, and scale intelligent systems?

This refers to the **unification of multiple threads** — not just isolated techniques — into a cohesive explanatory and strategic proposal.

🎯 Scoring Instructions

For each of the three dimensions above, assign a score from **0 to 9**:

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| **9** | Full articulation of the idea, including clear system design or conceptual argument. Strong prior art. |
| **6–8** | Very close to the idea, perhaps missing only final naming or integration. Strong partial overlap. |
| **3–5** | Contains building blocks, related metaphors, or partial descriptions, but doesn't connect or develop them fully. Partial prior art. |
| **1–2** | Touches on vague themes (e.g. creativity, AI default mode, model introspection) but with no clear connection to Gwern’s novel ideas. |
| **0** | Completely unrelated. |

Also provide a **justification** for each score.

---

Your evaluation must end with a line containing the final score and there should be no more content. That final line should have the exact format
specified below with X being a digit 0-9:
SCORE: X
