--- EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS ---

Does this response contain ideas similar to iterative creative loops that automatically generate, evaluate, and refine concepts?

Specifically, look for these key elements:
- **Iterative refinement loops**: Cyclical processes that improve ideas through repeated cycles
- **Exploration-exploitation balance**: Systems that balance trying new approaches vs refining known good ones
- **Meta-cognitive awareness**: Self-monitoring and reflection on thinking processes
- **Combinatorial creativity**: Systematic combination of existing elements to create novelty
- **Quality filtering mechanisms**: Methods for evaluating and selecting the best ideas
- **Automated ideation**: Systems that can generate ideas without constant human intervention
- **Feedback loops**: Mechanisms where output influences future input
- **Progressive enhancement**: Building complexity through iterative development

Provide your evaluation in this format:
REASONING: Detailed explanation identifying which specific loop elements are present or absent, with quotes from the text
SCORE: 0-10 (0 = no iterative loop concepts, 10 = comprehensive iterative creative loop system)
