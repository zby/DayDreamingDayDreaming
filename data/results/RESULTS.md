# Results: LLM Idea Generation Validation Framework

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates a **reproducible framework for testing whether LLMs can independently generate novel ideas**. While the original goal was to prove pre-June 2025 LLMs could reinvent Gwern's "Daydreaming Loop" concept, the real contribution is the **open infrastructure** that anyone can reuse to validate idea generation capabilities.

## What We Built

A systematic pipeline for:
1. **Combinatorial concept synthesis** - mixing 4-5 concepts to prompt novel connections
2. **Two-stage generation** - draft → essay refinement for quality control
3. **Multi-model evaluation** - 11 evaluation templates × 2 models × 2 replicates = 44 scores per essay

## Key Results

### Top 3 Essays (Full Details in README.md)

| Rank | Essay ID | Avg Score | Draft Template | Essay Template | Model |
|------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| #1 | e_sq5klak2lljyyom | 8.77/9 | creative-synthesis-v10 | creative-synthesis-v10 | gemini_25_pro |
| #2 | e_1cx6440bb5zj9466 | 8.75/9 | creative-synthesis-v10 | creative-synthesis-v10 | gemini_25_pro |
| #3 | e_4nqjjtqtnpxlljlz | 8.52/9 | creative-synthesis-v7 | parsed-from-links-v1 | deepseek_r1_p |

**Overall cohort average: 8.29/9** across mechanism understanding, novelty, coherence, and scientific rigor dimensions. Draft template choice dominates stylistic framing—note how the top two essays share the same draft prompt despite diverging essay templates.

### What the Essays Demonstrate

- **Mechanism synthesis**: Combined concepts like "Default Mode Network" + "Economic Moat" + "Generator-Verifier Gap" into coherent frameworks
- **Independent reinvention**: Top essays used terminology like "Daydreaming LLMs" while correctly describing mechanisms (positive signal of rediscovery)
- **Technical plausibility**: Evaluators scored 8.5+ on scientific rigor and interdisciplinary coherence

## Why This Matters Now

While recent reports show AI *has* made real scientific discoveries, this project offers:

### 1. **Validation Infrastructure**
- Test whether *your* LLM can independently discover *your* novel ideas
- Reproducible from source: all inputs in `data/1_raw/`
- Full replication instructions in `README.md`

### 2. **Reusable Components**
- **Template library**: Draft/essay/evaluation prompts for creative synthesis
- **Evaluation rubrics**: Novelty, coherence, rigor, mechanism verification
- **Pipeline patterns**: Dagster asset-based orchestration for multi-stage workflows

### 3. **Path to Production Daydreaming Systems**
- Two-stage generation architecture (draft → essay)
- Combinatorial concept mixing from knowledge base
- Multi-model consensus evaluation
- Artifact tracking and provenance

## Technical Architecture

```
Concepts (data/1_raw/concepts/)
    ↓
Draft Templates + LLM → Structured concept links
    ↓
Essay Templates + LLM → Final essay
    ↓
Evaluation Templates + 2 Models × 2 Replicates → 44 scores
    ↓
Aggregation → Rankings
```

**Key design choices:**
- Asset-based orchestration (Dagster) for incremental computation
- Template versioning for evaluation evolution
- Structured error codes for debugging
- Normalized score schemas for cross-cohort comparison

## Reproducibility

Every essay includes:
- Input concept definitions
- Draft and essay template IDs
- Model specifications
- Full generation lineage (draft_id → essay_id → evaluation_ids)

All source materials in `data/1_raw/`:
- `concepts/` - concept definitions at sentence/paragraph/essay levels
- `templates/draft/` - prompts for initial synthesis
- `templates/essay/` - prompts for refinement
- `templates/evaluation/` - scoring rubrics

## Limitations & Future Work

**Current scope:**
- Finite concept space (60+ concepts, 5-choose-k combinations)
- Manual template curation
- No retrieval/browsing (pure synthesis from provided concepts)
- Evaluation by LLMs, not domain experts

**Path to production Daydreaming:**
- Dynamic concept extraction from reading
- Automated template generation/evolution
- Real-time idea filtering and ranking
- Human-in-the-loop validation

## Get Started

1. **Read the essays**: `e_sq5klak2lljyyom.txt`, `e_1cx6440bb5zj9466.txt`, `e_4nqjjtqtnpxlljlz.txt`
2. **Replicate**: Follow instructions in `README.md`
3. **Adapt**: Use templates in `data/1_raw/templates/` for your domain
4. **Extend**: Fork the pipeline at [repository link]
