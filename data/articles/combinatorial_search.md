# Combinatorial Search

## Overview

Combinatorial search is a fundamental area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with finding solutions to problems that involve exploring vast spaces of discrete possibilities. These problems typically involve finding the best combination or arrangement of elements from a finite set, where the number of possible combinations grows exponentially with the problem size.

## Definition and Scope

Combinatorial search encompasses algorithms and techniques for systematically exploring solution spaces where:
- The solution consists of a combination of discrete elements
- The search space is finite but potentially enormous
- Finding the optimal solution through exhaustive search is computationally intractable
- Heuristic methods are needed to find good solutions efficiently

### Problem Characteristics
Typical combinatorial search problems exhibit:
- **Discrete solution spaces**: Solutions are combinations of distinct elements
- **Exponential growth**: Solution space size grows exponentially with problem parameters
- **Constraint satisfaction**: Solutions must satisfy specific constraints
- **Optimization objectives**: Goal is to find the best solution according to some criterion

## Fundamental Concepts

### State Space
The state space in combinatorial search represents:
- **States**: Partial or complete solutions to the problem
- **Actions**: Operations that transform one state into another
- **Goal states**: States that represent valid solutions
- **Path cost**: The cost associated with reaching a particular state

### Search Tree
Combinatorial problems are often represented as trees where:
- **Root node**: Initial state or empty solution
- **Internal nodes**: Partial solutions or intermediate states
- **Leaf nodes**: Complete solutions or dead ends
- **Branches**: Possible choices or actions at each decision point

### Combinatorial Explosion
The central challenge in combinatorial search is managing exponential growth:
- **Factorial growth**: Problems like permutations grow as n!
- **Exponential growth**: Problems with binary choices grow as 2^n
- **Polynomial but large**: Some problems have polynomial but practically intractable complexity

## Problem Categories

### Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)
Problems where the goal is to find assignments that satisfy all constraints:
- **Variables**: Elements that need to be assigned values
- **Domains**: Possible values for each variable
- **Constraints**: Restrictions on valid value combinations
- **Examples**: Sudoku, graph coloring, scheduling problems

### Optimization Problems
Problems that seek to minimize or maximize an objective function:
- **Traveling Salesman Problem**: Find shortest route visiting all cities
